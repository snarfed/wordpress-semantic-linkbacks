Richer Comments and Linkbacks for WordPress!

## Description ##

Generates richer WordPress comments from linkbacks such as [Webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention) or classic linkback protocols like Trackback or Pingback.

The limited display for trackbacks and linkbacks is replaced by a clean full sentence, such as "Bob mentioned this article on bob.com." If Bob's site uses markup that the plugin can interpret, it may add his profile picture or other parts of his page to display as a full comment. It will optionally show collections of profile pictures, known as Facepiles, instead of the full setences.

Semantic Linkbacks uses [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) to get information about the linked post and it is highly extensible to also add support for other forms of markup.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Do I need to mark up my site? ###

Most modern WordPress themes support the older Microformats standard, which means the plugin should be able to get basic information from
to enhance linkbacks. The plugin is most useful with webmention support(separate plugin) and sites/themes that support Microformats 2.

### Why Webmentions? ###

[Webmention](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) is a modern reimplementation of Pingback and is now a W3C Recommendation.

### What about the semantic "comment" types? ###

The IndieWeb community defines several types of feedback:

* Replies: <http://indieweb.org/replies>
* Reposts: <http://indieweb.org/repost>
* Likes: <http://indieweb.org/likes>
* Favorites: <http://indieweb.org/favorite>
* RSVPs: <http://indieweb.org/rsvp>
* Tagging: <http://indieweb.org/tag>
* Classic "Mentions": <http://indieweb.org/mentions>

### How do I extend this plugin? ###

See [Extensions](https://indieweb.org/Semantic_Linkbacks#Extensions)

### How do I add this into my plugin? ###

The plugin will automatically enhance webmentions, trackbacks, and pingbacks with an avatar and additional context. It will also automatically add a facepile instead of individual
comments, but this feature can either be turned off by an aware theme or under Discussion in your Settings.

### Why do some [emoji reactions](https://indieweb.org/reacji) not show up? ###

Some emoji characters in webmentions you might receive, e.g. Facebook reactions from [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/), take more than two bytes to encode. (In technical terms, these Unicode characters are [above the Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)).) To handle them, you need MySQL 5.5.3 or higher, and your database and tables need to use the [`utf8mb4` charset](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-mysql.html). [Usually WordPress does this automatically](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/02/the-utf8mb4-upgrade/), but not always.

First, [follow these instructions](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/195046/relaunch-4-2-utf8mb4-databse-upgrade/244992#244992) to switch your MySQL database to `utf8mb4`. Then, make sure `DB_CHARSET` and `DB_COLLATE` in your `wp-config.php` are either unset, set to the blank string, or set to these values:

    define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');
    define('DB_COLLATE', 'utf8mb4_general_ci');

### Who made the logos? ###

The Webmention and Pingback logos are made by [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com) and the Microformats logo is made by [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/work/microformats/)
